// TODO:
// - Consider how f32/f64 fields impact needs for Eq/Hash if ReputationProfile or Event instances were used as HashMap keys.
//   For now, PartialEq is sufficient.
// - Implement actual reputation scoring algorithms and the apply_update function.
// - Design DAG anchoring for profiles and events (possibly via ReputationRecord).
// - Define ReputationRecord struct (timestamp, event, issuer, signature).
