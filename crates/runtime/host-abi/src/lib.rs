// WASM modules will import functions matching these signatures (extern "C" style).

// All functions returning `i32` use codes from `HostAbiError` for errors (negative values),
// or non-negative values for success (often 0 for simple success, or bytes written/read).
// Pointers (`_ptr` suffixed arguments) are u32 offsets into the WASM module's linear memory.
// Lengths (`_len` suffixed arguments) are u32 byte counts for the data at the corresponding pointer.
