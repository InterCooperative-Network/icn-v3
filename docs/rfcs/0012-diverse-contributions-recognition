## Summary

This RFC defines a flexible, extensible recognition layer for ICN that allows cooperatives, communities, and federations to acknowledge and reward **non-compute contributions**â€”such as mentoring, governance, moderation, organizing, or documentation. It introduces **social minting** mechanisms and expands the utility of **ICN-NFR** tokens as proof of meaningful engagement.

## Motivation

Legacy economies undervalue contributions that are:
- Intangible (e.g. organizing, care work)
- Long-term or slow-burn (e.g. stewardship, teaching)
- Hard to automate or quantify

ICN must counteract this by allowing these forms of labor to be **recognized, anchored, and rewarded**, optionally with economic or reputational weight.

## Key Concepts

### Contribution Classes
A contribution may be recognized under any cooperative-defined schema, e.g.:
- `Mentorship`
- `Governance Participation`
- `Issue Review`
- `Outreach`
- `Crisis Response`

### Recognition Event
A new message and anchorable data type:
```rust
struct ContributionAcknowledgement {
    contributor_did: String,
    scope: Scope,
    class: String,
    description: String,
    acknowledged_by: Vec<String>, // quorum or individual DIDs
    timestamp: Timestamp,
    optional_cred: Option<VerifiableCredential>
}
```

### Social Minting
Recognized contributions may:
- Automatically generate **ICN-NFR tokens**.
- Trigger **mana regen boosts** or **reputation increases**.
- Be scoped to communities or federations.

CCL policies define:
- Required acknowledgment quorum
- Token multipliers by class
- Expiry or decay (if temporary recognition is desired)

## Implementation Plan

1. Add `ContributionAcknowledgement` to `icn-types`
2. Add anchoring logic to `ConcreteHostEnvironment`
3. Add social minting flow to runtime + wallet
4. Expose recognition in dashboards
5. Extend `ExecutionReceipt` filtering/indexing by contribution type
6. Allow CCL to govern token conversion and reputation effects

## Open Questions
- Should social minting be automatic or proposal-driven?
- Should NFRs from contributions be tradable or strictly soulbound?
- What mechanisms prevent reputation farming via empty acknowledgements?
