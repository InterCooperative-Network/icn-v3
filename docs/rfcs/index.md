# ICN RFC Index

This document provides a navigable index of all published RFCs (Requests for Comments) in the InterCooperative Network. RFCs are grouped by thematic series (e.g., architecture, core systems, networking) according to their numeric prefix.

Each series reserves a numeric range (e.g., `0001‚Äì0009`, `0010‚Äì0019`) and may expand over time as new RFCs are accepted.
