# Phase 2 Implementation Summary

## Overview

Phase 2 ("Verifiable Governance Foundations") builds on the cryptographic foundations established in Phase 1. This phase implements the necessary components for governance, including Verifiable Credential (VC) normalization, TrustBundle enhancements with quorum validation, and Contract Chain Language (CCL) templates for governance.

## Components Implemented

### 1. VC Normalization and Signing

We've implemented the following features in `icn-identity-core/src/vc.rs`:

- `VerifiableCredential::canonical_bytes()`: Produces deterministic serialization of VCs
- `VerifiableCredential::sign()`: Signs a VC with a given keypair
- `VerifiableCredential::verify()`: Verifies a VC signature against a public key
- `VerifiableCredential::with_signature()`: Creates a fully signed VC with proper proof structure

These enhancements enable deterministic handling of VCs, ensuring that they can be verified consistently across different implementations.

### 2. TrustBundle Enhancements

We've implemented quorum validation for TrustBundles:

- Created `QuorumRule` with three validation modes:
  - `Majority`: More than 50% of authorized participants
  - `Threshold(u8)`: Specified percentage of authorized participants
  - `Weighted`: Different weights for different participants
  
- Added `QuorumConfig` for configuration of quorum validation

- Enhanced `TrustBundle` with:
  - `verify()`: Validates all credentials and checks quorum satisfaction
  - `extract_signers()`: Gets the list of issuers from the bundle
  - `validate_quorum()`: Checks if the bundle satisfies a specific quorum rule

These additions enable flexible governance validation based on different quorum models.

### 3. CCL Template System

We've implemented a Contract Chain Language (CCL) parser and template system:

- Created Pest grammar for parsing CCL files
- Implemented data structures for representing CCL documents
- Added conversion to DSL representation
- Created three template files:
  - `bylaws.ccl`: Governance structure for cooperatives
  - `budget.ccl`: Budget allocation and spending rules
  - `election.ccl`: Election processes for roles

All templates include the required `anchor_data`, `mint_token`, and `perform_metered_action` constructs.

### 4. Documentation

We've created an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for quorum proofs:

- [ADR-0003-quorum-proof.md](architecture/adr/ADR-0003-quorum-proof.md): Documents the design decisions around quorum validation

## Test Coverage

- Tests for VC normalization and signing
- Tests for TrustBundle verification and quorum validation
- Tests for CCL template parsing

## Next Steps

1. Implement integration tests for DAG-anchored bundles
2. Add full CCL → DSL → WASM compilation pipeline
3. Implement TrustBundle runtime verification
4. Create a more extensive set of CCL templates for different governance models
