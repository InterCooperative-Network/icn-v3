# RFC: Mesh P2P Protocol Specification

## 1. Introduction

This RFC provides a detailed specification for the peer-to-peer (P2P) communication protocol used within the ICN Planetary Mesh. The "Planetary Mesh Architecture" RFC (RFC-0001) outlines the conceptual framework, core components like the `MeshNode`, and the overall operational flows of the mesh. This document builds directly upon that foundation by formally defining the wire-level details of the messages exchanged between `MeshNode`s.

The primary motivation for this specification is to ensure unambiguous communication, facilitate interoperable implementations of `MeshNode`s, and establish a clear versioning strategy for protocol evolution. By formalizing the schema, validation rules, expected interaction patterns, and security considerations for each message variant within the `MeshProtocolMessage` enum, this RFC aims to:

* Serve as a definitive guide for developers building or integrating with the Planetary Mesh.
* Enable third-party auditing and verification of protocol compliance.
* Provide a stable base for future extensions and upgrades to the P2P layer.
* Clarify the precise usage of underlying libp2p transport mechanisms (Gossipsub, Kademlia DHT, direct messaging) in the context of specific mesh operations.

This document will cover transport mechanisms, protocol versioning, a detailed breakdown of each `MeshProtocolMessage` variant, topic structures, security rules, and considerations for future compatibility.
