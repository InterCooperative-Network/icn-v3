## Security Best Practices

### Key and DID Management

Private keys and DIDs are the cornerstone of security in ICN v3. Protecting these assets is critical.

#### Private Key Security

1. **Cold Storage for Federation Admin Keys**
   - Store federation administrator keys offline in air-gapped hardware wallets or HSMs
   - Use multisig ceremonies for critical federation operations
   - Never store private keys in configuration files or environment variables

2. **Key Rotation**
   - Rotate operator and official keys every 90 days
   - Use a key rotation ceremony with multiple witnesses
   - Document each key rotation in a secure log

3. **Key Backup**
   - Create encrypted backups of all keys
   - Store backups in multiple secure locations
   - Test key recovery procedures regularly

#### DID Management

1. **DID Registration**
   - Verify DID ownership before registering in federation trust bundles
   - Use multiple federation admins to validate new DIDs
   - Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning roles to DIDs

2. **DID Revocation**
   - Establish a clear procedure for revoking compromised DIDs
   - Maintain a federation-wide revocation list
   - Audit DID usage regularly

### Network Security

1. **TLS Everywhere**
   - Use TLS 1.3 for all federation, cooperative, and community node communications
   - Rotate TLS certificates every 90 days
   - Use Let's Encrypt or a similar CA for certificate management

2. **Network Segmentation**
   - Run federation nodes in their own network segment
   - Separate cooperative nodes from federation infrastructure
   - Use firewalls to restrict access to node administrative interfaces

3. **Rate Limiting and DoS Protection**
   - Implement rate limiting on all public APIs
   - Use a CDN or DoS protection service for public endpoints
   - Monitor for unusual traffic patterns

### Access Control

1. **JWT Token Security**
   - Set short expirations (24 hours maximum) for JWT tokens
   - Validate all claims and scopes on every request
   - Use a secure token storage solution for clients

2. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Follow the principle of least privilege
   - Regularly audit role assignments
   - Revoke unused or unnecessary permissions

3. **API Security**
   - Validate all inputs on API endpoints
   - Use content security policy headers
   - Implement API versioning for backward compatibility

### Monitoring and Auditing

1. **Logging**
   - Log all administrative actions with DID attribution
   - Use structured logging with appropriate log levels
   - Forward logs to a secure, centralized location

2. **Metrics**
   - Monitor node health metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
   - Track governance proposal metrics (submission, voting, execution)
   - Set up alerts for unusual activity

3. **Audit Trail**
   - Maintain a cryptographically verifiable audit trail of all governance actions
   - Regularly review audit logs for suspicious activity
   - Archive audit logs according to data retention policies

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Procedures

1. **What to Back Up**
   - Private keys and DIDs (securely encrypted)
   - DAG store data
   - Configuration files
   - Trust bundles
   - Policy files
   - Execution receipts

2. **Backup Frequency**
   - Federation state: Daily incremental, weekly full
   - Cooperative state: Daily incremental, weekly full
   - Community state: Daily incremental, weekly full
   - Credentials: After any changes

3. **Backup Storage**
   - Store backups in multiple geographic locations
   - Encrypt all backup data
   - Test backup integrity monthly

### Recovery Procedures

#### Federation Recovery

1. **Trust Bundle Recovery**
   - Retrieve the latest trust bundle backup
   - Verify its signatures using offline keys
   - Reinitialize the DAG store with the trust bundle
   
2. **Federation Node Recovery**
   ```bash
   # Restore federation from backup
   mkdir -p /var/lib/icn/federation/$FEDERATION_ID
   # Restore DAG store
   tar -xzf /path/to/backup/dag_store.tar.gz -C /var/lib/icn/federation/$FEDERATION_ID/
   # Restore configuration
   cp /path/to/backup/federation_$FEDERATION_ID.yaml /etc/icn/
   # Restart federation node
   systemctl restart icn-federation-node
   ```

3. **Federation Trust Reconstruction**
   - If trust bundle is lost, regenerate it using admin keys
   - Have all federation admins sign the new trust bundle
   - Distribute the new trust bundle to all cooperatives

#### Cooperative Recovery

1. **Cooperative Node Recovery**
   ```bash
   # Restore cooperative from backup
   mkdir -p /var/lib/icn/cooperative/$COOPERATIVE_ID
   # Restore data
   tar -xzf /path/to/backup/cooperative_data.tar.gz -C /var/lib/icn/cooperative/$COOPERATIVE_ID/
   # Restore configuration
   cp /path/to/backup/cooperative_$COOPERATIVE_ID.yaml /etc/icn/
   # Restart cooperative node
   systemctl restart icn-cooperative-node
   ```

2. **Token State Recovery**
   - Restore token ledger from the latest backup
   - Verify token balances against the last known state
   - If discrepancies exist, use federation receipts to reconstruct the correct state

3. **Cooperative Registration Recovery**
   - If cooperative registration is lost, re-register with the federation
   - Ensure all operator DIDs are correctly registered
   - Restore token issuance policies

#### Community Recovery

1. **Community Node Recovery**
   ```bash
   # Restore community from backup
   mkdir -p /var/lib/icn/community/$COMMUNITY_ID
   # Restore data
   tar -xzf /path/to/backup/community_data.tar.gz -C /var/lib/icn/community/$COMMUNITY_ID/
   # Restore configuration
   cp /path/to/backup/community_$COMMUNITY_ID.yaml /etc/icn/
   # Restart community node
   systemctl restart icn-community-node
   ```

2. **Policy Recovery**
   - Restore policy files from backup
   - Redeploy policies to the community node
   - Verify policy execution receipts

3. **Service Configuration Recovery**
   - Restore service configurations from backup
   - Verify service resource allocations
   - Check service beneficiary lists

### Emergency Response Procedures

1. **Key Compromise**
   - If an admin key is compromised:
     1. Immediately revoke the key from the trust bundle
     2. Generate a new key
     3. Update the trust bundle with the new key
     4. Distribute the updated trust bundle to all nodes

2. **Node Compromise**
   - If a node is compromised:
     1. Isolate the node from the network
     2. Preserve evidence for forensic analysis
     3. Rebuild the node from a clean image
     4. Restore from the last known good backup
     5. Rotate all access credentials

3. **Federation-Wide Compromise**
   - In case of severe compromise:
     1. Freeze all token operations
     2. Initiate federation emergency recovery procedure
     3. Regenerate all admin keys in a secure ceremony
     4. Create a new trust bundle with the new keys
     5. Verify the integrity of all DAG store data
     6. Gradually restore operations starting with the federation node

## Recovery Testing

Regular recovery testing is essential to ensure that these procedures work when needed.

1. **Scheduled Testing**
   - Test federation recovery quarterly
   - Test cooperative recovery quarterly
   - Test community recovery quarterly

2. **Documentation**
   - Document each recovery test
   - Note any issues or improvements
   - Update recovery procedures based on test results

3. **Training**
   - Train all administrators on recovery procedures
   - Conduct tabletop exercises for emergency scenarios
   - Ensure multiple team members can perform each recovery procedure

## Conclusion

Security and disaster recovery are ongoing processes that require vigilance and regular updates. By following these best practices and procedures, you can ensure the security and resilience of your ICN v3 deployment.
